 About
Fake news spreads misinformation and causes real-world harm. This project uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to accurately classify whether a news article is Fake or Real based on its content. It includes:

A trained LSTM model with 97%+ accuracy

Tokenizer saved and reused for consistent predictions

Clean and simple UI built using Streamlit

Ready to deploy on Streamlit Cloud or locally

 Tech Stack
Python 

TensorFlow / Keras 

Streamlit 

Pandas & NumPy

Sklearn

Pickle (for tokenizer saving/loading)

‚úÖ Model Accuracy
Metric	Value
Training Accuracy	97.5%
Validation Accuracy	97.3%
Loss (Val)	0.0822

Model was trained for 10 epochs using preprocessed news headlines and text content.

üîç How It Works
The input news text is tokenized using a pre-trained tokenizer (news_tokenizer.pkl).

The text is padded and passed into the LSTM model (lstm_fake_news_model.keras).

The model outputs a prediction (Fake or Real) based on learned patterns.
